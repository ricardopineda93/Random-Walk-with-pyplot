# Random-Walk-with-pyplot
Exploring graphical capabilities of pyplot using a random walk scenario.

Using a random walk case, where our origin point starts at 0,0 (x,y) coordinates and takes 'random steps' and use pyplot to map 
all the 'steps' the program took. The scatter plot maps all the points, indicating also what the origin, median, and final steps were and
gradually gets darker red to indicate the movement of the walk from beginning to end. Darkest red are the last several steps taken, lighter red being 
the first several.

Prompts user if they want to run another random walk simulation on console after plot has been drawn.
